name: Vault of the Matriarch
desc:
    Lady Evefen Stathiz, august matriarch of the clan, has certainly seen
    better days.  Her moldering bones lay scattered in several heaps.  The
    massive, marble sarcophagus that once guarded her rest has been dumped on
    its side and, strangely, dragged towards the entrance of the chamber.

    Most of the room's marble tile has been pilfered, as well as lamp sconces
    and various metal fixtures.

    There is a doorway missing a door to the west.
