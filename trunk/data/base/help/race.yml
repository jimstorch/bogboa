    The 'race' command is used during the character creation process to specify
    a race for your character.  The format is the word 'race' follow by a space
    and then the name of a playable race.

        race human

    Prior to entering the 'done' command, you may select another race by re-
    entering the 'race' command.  Depending on race configuration, selecting a
    race may reset your guild or gender settings.
