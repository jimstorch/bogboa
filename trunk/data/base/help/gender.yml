    The 'gender' command is used during character creation to specify the
    gender for your character.  The format is the word 'gender' follow by a
    space and then either the word 'male' or the word 'female':
        
        gender male

    You may change your selection by re-entering the 'gender' command at any
    time prior to using the 'done' command. Depending on gender restrictions,
    selecting a gender may clear your race or guild selections.
