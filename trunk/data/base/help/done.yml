    The 'done' command is used during character creation to tell the system
    you are finished selecting name, gender, race, guild, and password and
    would like to create a character with those settings.  The format is
    simply the word done with no other arguments:

        done

    You must have all six settings complete or the 'done' command will not
    work.
