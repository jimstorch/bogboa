    The 'name' command is used during the character creation process to specify
    the name you would like for your character.  The format is the word 'name'
    followed by a space and the name your like (as a single word); '^!name
    Shadowcleave^1'.

    Prior to saving your preferences with the '^!save^1' command, you may
    change your choice by using the '^!name^1' command again.

    Use proper capitalization as you wish it to appear; 'McCloud' vs 'mccloud'.

    Naming Policy:
    
    * Should fit in a fantasy setting.

    * Must not be derived from products, celebrities, or famous fictonal
      characters.

    * Must not imply rank, title, or authority.

    * Must not mimic a game NPC or another player.

    * Must not be derived from lewd, profane, political, or emotionally
      charged terms.

    * Must not reflect intolerance towards a culture, race, sex, or sexual
      orientation. 

    Do not interpret the computer's acceptance of your name as an indication
    that it passes administrative review.
