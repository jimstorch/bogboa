    There are eight character stats used by the game:
       
        ^!Agility^1 - reflexes, speed, balance, and flexibility.

        ^!Charisma^1 - good looks, persuasiveness, charm, and articulation.

        ^!Dexterity^1 - where agility measures speed, dexterity represent precision
            in movement and the ability to manipulate delicate objects.

        ^!Intelligence^1 - memory, comprehension, and problem solving.

        ^!Luck^1 - the favor of the gods. Always useful when things go awry.
  
        ^!Stamina^1 - heartiness, health, and resistance to tiring.
 
        ^!Strength^1 - the ability to perform acts of physical brawn.

        ^!Wisdom^1 - attunement with the natural world and spiritual strength.

    Every skill gains a bonus from the combination of two stats.  Each
    guild will typically favor one primary and two secondary stats.
