    There are eight character stats used by the game. 
       
        Agility - reflexes, speed, balance, and flexibility.
        Charisma - good looks, persuasiveness, charm, and articulation.
        Dexterity - where agility measures speed, dexterity represent precision
            in movement and the ability to manipulate delicate objects.
        Intelligence - memory, comprehension, and problem solving.
        Luck - the favor of the gods. Always useful when things go awry.  
        Stamina - heartiness, health, and resistance to tiring. 
        Strength - the ability to perform acts of physical brawn.
        Wisdom - attunement with the natural world and spiritual strength.

    Every skill gains a bonus from the combination of two stats.  Each
    guild will typically favor one primary and two secondary stats.
