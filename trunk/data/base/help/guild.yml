    The 'guild' command is used during the character creation process to 
    specify the guild your character will apprenticed to.  This is equivalent
    to term 'class' used in some role playing games.  The format is the word
    'guild' followed by a space and the name of the guild you wish to join:

        guild fighter  

    Prior to entering the 'done' command, you may select a different guild by
    re-entering the guild command.  Depending on guild restrictions, selecting
    a guild may clear your race or gender selections.

    Try the following help topics for more information:

        fighter, cleric, shaman, monk
