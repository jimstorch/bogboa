    Creating a new character is a simple matter of specifying six values;
    name, gender, race, guild, and password. You select each one using a 
    command followed by a single value.  For example, to set your name to 
    'Jack', simply type:

        name Jack

    You can change any of these settings by repeating the command with a new
    value.  Once you are happy with your selections, you can save with the
    'save' command and go play your new character. Don't lose your character
    name or password or else you wont be able to log back in later.  Passwords
    are case sensitive.

    Try the following topics for more information:

        help gender

        help race

        help guild

        help password
