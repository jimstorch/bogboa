text:

    The monk is a master of martial arts, unique in his ability to fight
    effectively using only his own body for a weapon -- though he is also
    effective using blunt weapons created in balance with nature.  

    The primary stat for a monk is wisdom, representing his special 
    comprehension and unity with the natural world.  Secondary stats are
    strength for dealing powerful blows and agility for gracefully dodging
    attacks.
