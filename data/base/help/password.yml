    The 'password' command is used during character creation to specify a
    password when loading this character on future visits.  The format is
    'password' followed by a space and then a series of characters for the
    password itself:

        password ihKL91zPP

    Passwords are case sensitive.  Prior to entering the 'done' command, you
    may select a different password by re-using the password command.
