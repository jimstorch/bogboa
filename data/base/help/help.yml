    Greetings, this is the help system.

    For a list of all the help topics enter 'topics'. To read a topic, enter
    'help' followed by the topic name.  For your convenience, you can enter a
     question mark '?' instead of typing the word 'help'.
  

    If you'd like a list of your current commands , simply type 'commands'
    (or the shortcut '??').  Your command set can change based on your location
    or status.
