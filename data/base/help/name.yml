    The 'name' command is used during the character creation process to specify
    the name you would like for your character.  The format is the word 'name'
    followed by a space and the name your like (as a single word):

        name Shadowcleave

    Prior to saving your preferences with the 'done' command, you may change
    your choice by using the 'name' command again.

    Use proper capitalization as you wish it to appear; 'McCloud' vs 'mccloud'.

    Naming Policy:
    
    * Should fit in a fantasy setting.
    * Must not be derived from trademarks, celebrities, or famous fictonal
      characters.
    * Must not imply rank, title, or authority.
    * Must not mimic a game NPC or another player.
    * Must not be derived from lewd, profane, or politically or emotionally
      charged terms.
    * Must not reflect intolerance towards culture, race, sex, or sexual
      orientation. 

    Do not interpret the computer's acceptance of your name as an indication
    that it passes administrative review.  In other words, if you pick an 
    idiotic handle, don't be surprised to find your character deleted.
