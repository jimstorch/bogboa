    The 'load' command is used to play a previously created character.
    The format is 'load' followed by the name and password you provided
    during the 'create' process:

        load Jack swordfish77

    Please note that both name and password are case sensitive and that your
    password will be displayed on your screen so -- look over your shoulder
    first, eh.
