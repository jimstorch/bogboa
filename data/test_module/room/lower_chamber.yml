name: Lower Chamber
desc:
    Sharing the same vaulted ceiling as the upper chamber, this sunken end
    is smaller and devoid of shelves.  A ponderous, iron door that once sealed
    an opening to west lays tumbled unto the floor.  Clearly, the robbers
    spent countless hours chipping deep sockets in the granite wall to dislodge
    its mighty hinges.   

    In addition to the violated entrance to the east, a hallway leads north and
    a short series of steps lead upward to the south.
