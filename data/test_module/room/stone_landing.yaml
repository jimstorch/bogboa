    Inset into the floor is a great marble slab bearing the Stathiz family
    crest.  The slab shows chips and chisel marks where someone failed to
    dislodge it.  In fact, the entire floor is scuffed and scarred.  To the
    south, an arched stairwell leads upward and short halls open to chambers
    both east and west.
