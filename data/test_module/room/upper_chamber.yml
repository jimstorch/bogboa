name: Upper Chamber
desc:
    The walls of this chamber are lined with burial shelves but the sealing
    stones have been ripped away and taken.  Gone too are all signs of coffins.
    Only the bones of the dead remain, robbed of all jewelry, preserved 
    clothing, and even buttons. 

    Five wide stairs split the room into a sunken chamber to the north and an
    archway leads to the west.
