    This is a small plateau.  Its crown has been worn into a shallow, stony
    bowl by the tread of many feet while the rest is covered in grass and wild
    flowers.  Ocean waves tumble below and the air smells of saltwater.

    To the North, a footpath leads down towards a small village.
    A wooden sign with the words 'Visitor Center' points towards an official
    looking stone building to the East.
