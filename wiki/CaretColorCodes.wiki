#Coloring Text Inline with Caret Codes

= Introduction =

In order to make text decorating easier, you can use the following caret codes inside blocks of text.  If the client has turned off color, the tokens are simply stripped out.

You'll notice there is a pattern to the codes which should be easy to remember -- lower case = dark/mode on, uppercase = bright/mode off.
